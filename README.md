# GeneticAndSimulatedAnnealing
In this repo, genetic and simulated annealing are used to optimize the Cross-in-Tray function <br>

## Genetic Algorithm
Each individual contains two chromosomes (x and y)
x and y for the first-generation are created randomly
The cross-In-Tray function always returns a negative value so the fitness function for each individual is :
fitness(Ind) = value of(Ind)/ sum of all population values
## Simulated Annealing
